# autopilot

This is a simple program and an attempt to create a simple autopilot.
This is work in progress.


Aimed features:
- compute position
- generate a list of position defining the trip (connecting points as a GPSwould )
- constraint points/paths (speed, allowed direction etc)
- environment checks (check speed limits, avoid car crashs, adapt speed and trajectory).
